abstract = {The dynamics of wind turbine rotor blades are generally expressed in rotating frames attached to the individual blades. The rotor, however, responds as a whole to excitations such as aerodynamic gusts, control inputs, and tower-nacelle motionall of which occur in a nonrotating frame. Similarly, the tower-nacelle subsystem sees the combined effect of all rotor blades, not the individual blades. Multi-blade coordinate transformation (MBC) helps integrate the dynamics of individual blades and express them in a fixed (nonrotating) frame. MBC involves two steps: transformation of the rotating degrees of freedom, and transformation of the equations of motion. This paper details the MBC operation. A new MBC scheme is developed that is applicable to variable-speed turbines, which may also have dissimilar blades. The scheme also covers control, disturbance, output, and feed-forward matrices. Depending on the analysis objective, wind turbine researchers may generate system matrices either in the first-order (state-space) form or the second-order (physical-domain) form. We develop MBC relations for both these forms. MBC is particularly essential for modal and stability analyses. Commonly, wind turbine researchers first compute the periodic state-space matrix, time-average it over the rotor rotational period, and then apply conventional eigenanalysis to compute modal and stability characteristics. Direct averaging, however, eliminates all periodic terms that contribute to system dynamics, thereby producing errors. While averaging itself is not always a bad approach, it must follow MBC. Sample results are presented to illustrate this point and also to show the application of MBC to the modal and stability analysis of a 5-MW turbine.},

The program reads a text-based settings file in conjunction with one or more time-series data files. Alternatively, the program can read parameter variables which were created using MATLAB, outside of MLife. The program generates results in the form of MATLAB variables, text output files, and/or Excel formatted files. This allows you to make other calculations or present the data in ways MLife cannot. The fatigue calculations include short-term damage-equivalent loads (DELs) and damage rates, which are based on single time-series, lifetime DEL results based on the entire set of time-series data, and the accumulated lifetime damage and the time until failure.},

The paper first presents a controller structure for selecting a proper operating trajectory as a function of estimated wind speed. The dynamic control law is based on LPV controller synthesis with general parameter dependency by gridding the parameter space. The controller construction can, for medium- to large-scale systems, be difficult from a numerical point of view, because the involved matrix operations tend to be ill-conditioned. The paper proposes a controller construction algorithm together with various remedies for improving the numerical conditioning the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is applied to the design of a LPV controller for wind turbines, and a comparison is made with a controller designed using classical techniques to conclude that an improvement in performance is obtained for the entire operating envelope.},

A nonlinear feedforward controller is extended by an adaptive filter to remove all uncorrelated frequencies of the wind speed measurement to avoid unnecessary control action. Positive effects on the rotor speed regulation as well as on tower, blade and shaft loads have been observed in the case that the previous measured correlation and timing between the wind preview and the turbine reaction are accomplish. The feedforward controller had negative impact, when the LIDAR measurement was disturbed by obstacles in front of the turbine. This work proves, that LIDAR is valuable tool for wind turbine control not only in simulations but also under real conditions. Furthermore, the paper shows that further understanding of the relationship between the wind measurement and the turbine reaction is crucial to improve LIDAR assisted control of wind turbines.},

abstract = {In wind farm operation, the performance and loads of downstream turbines are heavily influenced by the wake of the upstream turbines. Furthermore, the actual wake is more challenging due to the dynamic phenomenon of wake meandering, i.e. the turbine wake often demonstrates dynamic shift over time. To deal with the time-varying characteristics of wake meandering, a multiple model predictive control (MMPC) scheme is applied to the individual pitch control (IPC) based load reduction. The coherence function in the spectral method is used to generate the stochastic wind profile including wake meandering at upstream turbine, and a simplified wake meandering model is developed to emulate the trajectory of the wake center at downstream turbine. The Larsen wake model and Gaussian distribution of wake deficit are applied for composing wind profiles across the rotor of downstream turbines. A set of MMPC controllers are designed based on different linearized state-space models, and are applied in a smooth switching manner. Simulation results show significant reduction in the variation of both rotor speed and blade-root flapwise bending moment using the MMPC based IPC by including the wake meandering, as compared to a benchmark PI controller designed by NREL.},

@article{Satzger2017,
abstract = {This paper proposes a robust model predictive controller for linear parameter varying (LPV) systems subject to additive disturbances. The proposed controller relies on the constraint tightening method to guarantee that the MPC's optimization problem remains feasible in the presence of additive disturbances. In order to decrease the conservativeness, the controller synthesis considers bounded parameter rate variations in the construction of the tightened constraints. Relevant features, such as recursive feasibility and stability of the LPV-MPC, are theoretically proven. Finally, the proposed controller is applied to a wheel-slip control problem and its effectiveness is shown by simulation results.},
